# Real-time-plotting-and-musicalization-of-plant-potential
Investigation project in engineering 2021-20. Andrea GÃ³mez, Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia
This project plots in real time the electrical potentials taken with an Open BCI Cyton. It also musicalizes in real time, turning the potential into a specific notes and hence making music.
The GUI allows you to choose an instrument for the music, interact with diverse parameters from the music configuration and from the electrical signals' filter. You can also export the filtered data as a txt or the sound as a wav.

Hope you enjoy!
